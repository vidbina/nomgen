# Nomgen

## Usage

Start the Python container using `make shell`. Populate the syllables.txt file
with a list of syllables you want to use to design names such as the example
list demonstrated below:

```
ah
bah
doo
lee
lah
loo
mee
oh
see
sah
wah
woo
wop
```

and simply run `python gen.py`.

The output will be produced in `gen.txt` :wink:.
